      <h2>Lord Ganesha</h2>
      <p>
        Lord Ganesha, also known as Ganapati, is one of the most revered deities
        in Hinduism. Recognized by his elephant head, he is the remover of
        obstacles, patron of arts and sciences, and the god of intellect and
        wisdom. Ganesha is worshipped at the beginning of rituals and ceremonies
        and is celebrated during the festival of Ganesh Chaturthi. His symbolism
        includes wisdom, understanding, and a discriminating intellect that one
        must possess to attain perfection in life.
