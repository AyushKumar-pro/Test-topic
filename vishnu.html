      <h2>Lord Vishnu</h2>
      <p>
        Lord Vishnu is one of the principal deities of Hinduism, known as the
        preserver and protector of the universe. He is part of the holy trinity
        (Trimurti) alongside Brahma and Shiva. Vishnu is often depicted with
        blue skin and four arms, holding a conch, discus, mace, and lotus. He
        incarnates in various forms, known as avatars, to restore cosmic order,
        with Rama and Krishna being the most celebrated. Vishnu symbolizes
        mercy, goodness, and the power to maintain harmony in the world.
