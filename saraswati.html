      <h2>Goddess Saraswati</h2>
      <p>
        Goddess Saraswati is the Hindu goddess of knowledge, music, art, wisdom,
        and learning. She is often depicted dressed in white, seated on a lotus,
        and playing the veena, symbolizing purity and creative energy. Saraswati
        is revered by students and scholars, and her blessings are sought for
        success in education and the arts. The festival of Vasant Panchami is
        dedicated to her, celebrating the power of wisdom and the pursuit of
        knowledge.
