      <h2>Goddess Kali</h2>
      <p>
        Goddess Kali is a powerful and revered deity in Hinduism, known as the
        goddess of time, change, destruction, and empowerment. She is often
        depicted with a fierce expression, dark skin, and a necklace of skulls,
        symbolizing her role in destroying evil and protecting the innocent.
        Kali represents the transformative power of time and the cycles of
        creation and destruction. She is worshipped for her ability to remove
        negative energies and grant liberation, and is especially honored during
        the festival of Kali Puja.
