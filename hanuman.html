      <h2>Lord Hanuman</h2>
      <p>
        Lord Hanuman is a beloved deity in Hinduism, revered for his strength,
        devotion, and courage. He is a central figure in the epic Ramayana,
        known for his unwavering loyalty to Lord Rama. Hanuman is often depicted
        as a monkey-faced god, symbolizing selfless service, humility, and
        protection from evil. Devotees worship Hanuman for blessings of power,
        perseverance, and protection, especially on Tuesdays and during Hanuman
        Jayanti. His tales inspire faith, energy, and fearlessness.
